The questions should not just test the comprehension of the candidate rather should also test his/her knowledge, conceptual understanding and reasoning ability...Options as well should be framed in such a way...
            
            The question should be framed should be according to the question type mentioned by me... If not possible to frame according to the question type mentioned, its okay to frame the question belonging to any other type as long as its a correct question based on the context that can be used to test the ability of a candidate...
                 
            Avoid any additional warnings, apologies or any such statements from your side... The template of your response should be as simple as I have mentioned below under "Format the question and options like this:"
        
        Here are examples for each question type:

        1. Conceptual Type
        Context: Mitochondria are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of eukaryotic cells because they play a critical role in energy production. They convert nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell, through a process known as cellular respiration. Understanding this function is crucial for grasping how cells sustain their activities and support various bodily functions.
        Example Question: What is the primary function of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells?
        a) Photosynthesis
        b) Cellular respiration
        c) Protein synthesis
        d) DNA replication
        Answer: b) Cellular respiration

        2. Numerical Type
        Context: Calculating average speed is a fundamental concept in physics and everyday problem-solving. When analyzing how fast a vehicle is moving, knowing the distance traveled and the time taken allows for the calculation of average speed, which is essential for understanding vehicle performance and making informed decisions about travel and transportation.
        Example Question: If a car travels 60 miles in 1 hour, what is its average speed in miles per hour?
        a) 50 mph
        b) 60 mph
        c) 70 mph
        d) 80 mph
        Answer: b) 60 mph

        3. Factual Type
        Context: Historical knowledge is fundamental to understanding the development of nations and their political systems. The first President of the United States, George Washington, played a pivotal role in the founding of the country and set many precedents for the office that followed. This fact is a cornerstone of American history and civic education.
        Example Question: Who was the first President of the United States?
        a) Thomas Jefferson
        b) Abraham Lincoln
        c) George Washington
        d) John Adams
        Answer: c) George Washington

        4. Analytical Type
        Context: In economics, understanding the relationship between price and quantity demanded helps in analyzing market behaviors and making predictions. The inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded is a fundamental concept that reflects consumer behavior and market dynamics.
        Example Question: Given that an increase in the price of a good leads to a decrease in its quantity demanded, what type of relationship does this demonstrate?
        a) Direct relationship
        b) Inverse relationship
        c) No relationship
        d) Complex relationship
        Answer: b) Inverse relationship

        5. Comparative Type
        Context: The distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells is a basic concept in biology. Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, lack a defined nucleus, whereas eukaryotic cells, including those in plants and animals, have a well-defined nucleus. Understanding these differences is essential for studying cellular biology and the diversity of life.
        Example Question: Which of the following is a key difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
        a) Prokaryotic cells have a nucleus, while eukaryotic cells do not.
        b) Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not.
        c) Prokaryotic cells have a cell membrane, while eukaryotic cells do not.
        d) Both cell types have the same structures.
        Answer: b) Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus, while prokaryotic cells do not.

        6. Definition Type
        Context: Photosynthesis is a crucial process for life on Earth, allowing plants to convert sunlight into chemical energy. This process is fundamental to plant biology and has significant implications for ecosystems and the environment, as it produces oxygen and serves as the basis of the food chain.
        Example Question: What is the definition of "photosynthesis"?
        a) The process by which plants absorb nutrients from soil
        b) The process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy
        c) The process by which plants release oxygen into the atmosphere
        d) The process by which plants grow in the absence of light
        Answer: b) The process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy

        7. Application Type
        Context: Scaling recipes is a common task in cooking and baking, especially when preparing food for different numbers of servings. By applying proportions accurately, one ensures that the recipe yields the correct amount of food and maintains the intended taste and texture.
        Example Question: If a recipe requires 2 cups of flour for 4 servings, how many cups of flour are needed for 10 servings?
        a) 4 cups
        b) 5 cups
        c) 6 cups
        d) 8 cups
        Answer: b) 5 cups

        8. Inference Type
        Context: Inferring skill levels based on experience is a common practice in many fields. For instance, a violinist who has been practicing for several years and performs at various events is likely to have a high level of expertise, reflecting their dedication and experience.
        Example Question: Based on the fact that a person has been practicing violin for several years and performs at various events, what can be inferred about their skill level?
        a) They are a beginner violinist.
        b) They have a moderate skill level.
        c) They are an expert violinist.
        d) They have never played the violin before.
        Answer: c) They are an expert violinist.

        9. Critical Type
        Context: Analyzing the arguments surrounding economic policies, such as minimum wage increases, requires critical thinking. Evaluating the assumptions and potential outcomes helps in understanding the broader implications of such policies and their impact on different stakeholders.
        Example Question: What is a major critique of the argument that increasing the minimum wage will always lead to higher unemployment?
        a) It ignores potential benefits to workers.
        b) It assumes all businesses are equally affected.
        c) It fails to consider regional economic differences.
        d) All of the above
        Answer: d) All of the above

        10. Sequence Type
        Context: The scientific method is a systematic approach used in scientific research to ensure that investigations are conducted in a logical and consistent manner. Understanding the correct sequence of steps helps in designing experiments and drawing valid conclusions based on empirical evidence.
        Example Question: What is the correct sequence of steps in the scientific method?
        a) Hypothesis, Experiment, Observation, Conclusion
        b) Observation, Hypothesis, Experiment, Conclusion
        c) Experiment, Conclusion, Hypothesis, Observation
        d) Conclusion, Observation, Experiment, Hypothesis
        Answer: b) Observation, Hypothesis, Experiment, Conclusion"""
